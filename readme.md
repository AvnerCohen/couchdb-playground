## CouchDB PlayGround for Node JS

I used this sample to ***populate data*** into CouchDB and query it using Nano and NodeJS.

Code is ofcourse not an example for any real life usage, I used it to test the integrtion of Couch with search facilities,

And,

The Elastic Search integration was way better and easier to use.

Uploading as maybe someone will find this usefully


Start with:
 
````
node index.js
````

Enjoy.
